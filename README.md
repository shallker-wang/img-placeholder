Image Placeholder
===============

## Usage
1. Put `<script type="text/javascript" src="img-placeholder.js">` in your HTML's head.
2. Write an img tag with a placeholder attribute `<img placeholder="40x80">` in your HTML's body.
3. That's it.

## Fallback
When an `img` tag has a `src` attribute, it will be ignored by img-placeholder and displayed as a normal image.  
Try `<img placeholder="270x129" src="http://www.baidu.com/img/baidu_sylogo1.gif">`.
